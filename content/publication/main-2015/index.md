abstract: Vibrio species are an abundant and diverse group of bacteria that form associations
  with phytoplankton. Correlations between Vibrio and phytoplankton abundance have
  been noted, suggesting that growth is enhanced during algal blooms or that association
  with phytoplankton provides a refuge from predation. Here, we investigated relationships
  between particle-associated Vibrio spp. and phytoplankton in Delaware's inland bays
  (DIB). The relative abundances of particle-associated Vibrio spp. and algal classes
  that form blooms in DIB (dinoflagellates, diatoms, and raphidophytes) were determined
  using quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated a significant correlation between
  particle-associated Vibrio abundance and phytoplankton, with higher correlations
  to diatoms and raphidophytes than to dinoflagellates. Species-specific associations
  were examined during a mixed bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica
  (Raphidophyceae) and indicated a significant positive correlation for particle-associated
  Vibrio abundance with H. akashiwo but a negative correlation with F. japonica .
  Changes in Vibrio assemblages during the bloom were evaluated using automated ribosomal
  intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which revealed significant differences between
  each size fraction but no significant change in Vibrio assemblages over the course
  of the bloom. Microzooplankton grazing experiments showed that losses of particle-associated
  Vibrio spp. may be offset by increased growth in the Vibrio population. Moreover,
  analysis of Vibrio assemblages by ARISA also indicated an increase in the relative
  abundance for specific members of the Vibrio community despite higher grazing pressure
  on the particle-associated population as a whole. The results of this investigation
  demonstrate links between phytoplankton and Vibrio that may lead to predictions
  of potential health risks and inform future management practices in this region.
