 abstract = {Molec ular methods such as quantitative re al-time PCR (qPCR) and sandwich hybridization assay (SHA) enable a morerapid and specific e num eration of harmful algal species com pa red to m icroscop ic cell counts. Integr ating th es e methodsinto routine monitoring and management s trategies, however, has been slow. While comparisons to microscopy h ave beenm ade , direct compari son s betw ee n m olecular meth ods using environ mental samples are spar se. Here, w e dire ctly compareqPCR to SHA for enumer ating the h armful algal spec ies, Heterosigma akashiwo, in environmental samples collected i nDelaware's in land bays. To ensure comparability, a single cellular homo genate was gen erated from f ield sam ples and splitf or ana lysis by qPCR and SHA. Re sults show a signifi ca nt correlation between qPCR an d SHA w hen Heterosigma isabove bloom levels (1 × 105c ells L−1), but not during non-bloom con ditions. qPCR and SHA were also more h ighlycorrelated when s amples were colle cted at low er temperatures (\textless 25 °C) and/ or w ith high levels of chlorophyll a ( greaterthan or equal to 30 $μ$g L−1), indepe ndent of Heteros igma cell co ncentration. There was no evidence of cross-reactivity inprimers and probes for H. akashiwo during b looms of the closely related spe cies, Chattonel la subsalsa. Howe ve r, qPCR toSHA ratios were e le vat ed during blooms of other phy toplankton species, sugge sting supp re ssion of the SHA signal orenhancement o f qPCR. Results of this study may have significant imp lic ati ons for resea rch , where prec ise evaluations ofcell n umbers are often required. However, precise cell counts at non-bloom levels may not be as critical to management,suggesting either te chnique could be i ncorporated into rapid and effective decision making.},
