Integr ating th es e methodsinto routine monitoring and management s trategies, however, has been slow. While comparisons to microscopy h ave beenm ade , direct compari son s betw ee n m olecular meth ods using environ mental samples are spar se. Here, w e dire ctly compareqPCR to SHA for enumer ating the h armful algal spec ies, Heterosigma akashiwo, in environmental samples collected i nDelaware's in land bays. To ensure comparability, a single cellular homo genate was gen erated from f ield sam ples and splitf or ana lysis by qPCR and SHA. Re sults show a signifi ca nt correlation between qPCR an d SHA w hen Heterosigma isabove bloom levels (1 × 105c ells L−1), but not during non-bloom con ditions. qPCR and SHA were also more h ighlycorrelated when s amples were colle cted at low er temperatures ({\textless} 25 °C) and/ or w ith high levels of chlorophyll a ( greaterthan or equal to 30 $\mu$g L−1), indepe ndent of Heteros igma cell co ncentration. There was no evidence of cross-reactivity inprimers and probes for H. akashiwo during b looms of the closely related spe cies, Chattonel la subsalsa.

Results of this study may have significant imp lic ati ons for resea rch , where prec ise evaluations ofcell n umbers are often required. However, precise cell counts at non-bloom levels may not be as critical to management,suggesting either te chnique could be i ncorporated into rapid and effective decision making.},

abstract = {Vibrio species are an abundant and diverse group of bacteria that form associations with phytoplankton. Correlations between Vibrio and phytoplankton abundance have been noted, suggesting that growth is enhanced during algal blooms or that association with phytoplankton provides a refuge from predation. Here, we investigated relationships between particle-associated Vibrio spp. and phytoplankton in Delaware's inland bays (DIB). The relative abundances of particle-associated Vibrio spp. and algal classes that form blooms in DIB (dinoflagellates, diatoms, and raphidophytes) were determined using quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated a significant correlation between particle-associated Vibrio abundance and phytoplankton, with higher correlations to diatoms and raphidophytes than to dinoflagellates. Species-specific associations were examined during a mixed bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica (Raphidophyceae) and indicated a significant positive correlation for particle-associated Vibrio abundance with H. akashiwo but a negative correlation with F. japonica . Changes in Vibrio assemblages during the bloom were evaluated using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which revealed significant differences between each size fraction but no significant change in Vibrio assemblages over the course of the bloom. Microzooplankton grazing experiments showed that losses of particle-associated Vibrio spp. may be offset by increased growth in the Vibrio population. Moreover, analysis of Vibrio assemblages by ARISA also indicated an increase in the relative abundance for specific members of the Vibrio community despite higher grazing pressure on the particle-associated population as a whole. The results of this investigation demonstrate links between phytoplankton and Vibrio that may lead to predictions of potential health risks and inform future management practices in this region.},
